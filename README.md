# Smart-weather-reporting-with-alarming-system
This project is really helpful in the manner that it provides the current weather and notifies by an alert through a SMS and by a BUZZER alarm at different frequency for different weather condition and also, by powering up the LED at different intensity for different weathers. The twilio messaging service is used to send SMS to the user. The interesting factor is, here the weather data is collected without using any sensors but by an api provided by Openweathermap. We can get the weather of any place in the world by simply changing the name of the city in the api link. The Bolt Wi-fi module is connected by the python code written in terminal of the ubuntu OS in the system.
